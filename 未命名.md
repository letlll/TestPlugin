To export the file tree in the order displayed in Obsidian using the **Manual Sorting** plugin from [Kh4f's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kh4f/manual-sorting), you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Using the Manual Sorting Plugin in Obsidian**

First, ensure you have the **Manual Sorting** plugin installed and properly configured in Obsidian:

1. Open **Settings** in Obsidian.
    
2. Go to **Community Plugins** and search for **Manual Sorting**.
    
3. Install and enable the plugin.
    
4. Once enabled, you should be able to manually drag and drop files in the sidebar to reorder them as needed.
    

### 2. **Exporting File Tree with Manual Sorting**

After sorting your files with the **Manual Sorting** plugin, follow these steps to export the file tree with the custom order:

#### 2.1 **Install a File Tree Export Plugin**

If you're not already using one, you can install a plugin like **Obsidian Git** or any other plugin that can help you export the structure. The **Obsidian Git** plugin allows you to export files, but it may not directly reflect the custom order.

#### 2.2 **Using JavaScript to Capture the Sorted Order**

The **Manual Sorting** plugin alters the order in the sidebar visually, but it does not automatically change the file tree's HTML export behavior. To reflect this order in the exported HTML (`file-tree.html`), you would need to capture the order of the items in the sidebar dynamically.

Here’s a JavaScript solution you can use to reorder the file tree according to the manually sorted order:

1. **Export `file-tree.html` from Obsidian** (if your plugin does not offer direct export, you can use the built-in export option).
    
2. **Inject JavaScript into the exported file** to reorder the tree dynamically.
    

#### JavaScript for Sorting the Exported File Tree:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  // Get all the tree items
  const container = document.querySelector('.tree-container'); // The container that holds the file tree
  const items = Array.from(container.querySelectorAll('.tree-item')); // All file and folder items

  // Sort items based on the order they appear in the sidebar
  items.sort((a, b) => {
    const orderA = a.style.order || 0; // The current manual sort order (if available)
    const orderB = b.style.order || 0;
    return orderA - orderB; // Sort by manual order
  });

  // Append the sorted items back to the container
  items.forEach(item => container.appendChild(item));
});
```

#### How to Add This JavaScript:

1. Open your exported `file-tree.html`.
    
2. Add the script inside the `<head>` section or right before the closing `</body>` tag.
    

This script will ensure that the order of files in the HTML matches the manually sorted order as displayed in the sidebar.

### 3. **Adding Custom Styling to the File Tree**

Once the sorting is handled, you can also modify the appearance of the file tree using CSS to make it more visually appealing (e.g., adding background colors to folders, etc.).

Here’s an example of adding custom background colors to folders:

```css
/* Add background color to folders */
.tree-item.nav-folder {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}

/* Add hover effect to folders */
.tree-item.nav-folder:hover {
  background-color: #e0e0e0;
}
```

### 4. **Final Steps: Export the Customized File Tree**

After making these customizations to your `file-tree.html`, you can now use it as your exported file tree with the order reflecting the manual sorting.

### Summary of Process:

1. **Sort files in Obsidian using the Manual Sorting plugin**.
    
2. **Export the file tree** (either manually or using a plugin).
    
3. **Modify the exported HTML** by adding JavaScript to preserve the sorting and custom CSS for styling.
    
4. **View the updated, sorted file tree** in the exported HTML file.
    

This way, you can ensure that the exported file tree matches the order you see in Obsidian's sidebar and customize the look of folders in the file tree.
