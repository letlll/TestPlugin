# Hide Non-Breaking Space Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin helps you edit Markdown files by hiding non-breaking space entities (`&nbsp;`) in source mode, making your document cleaner and easier to read.

## Features

- Hides `&nbsp;` entities in source mode
- Shows a small indicator where non-breaking spaces are located
- Toggle visibility with a command or ribbon icon
- Replace all `&nbsp;` entities with regular spaces

## Usage

1. Enable the plugin in Obsidian settings
2. Non-breaking spaces will be automatically hidden in source mode
3. Use the ribbon icon to toggle visibility
4. Use command palette and search for "Toggle &nbsp; visibility" to toggle

## Commands

- **Toggle &nbsp; visibility in source mode**: Toggles the visibility of non-breaking spaces
- **Replace &nbsp; with regular space**: Replaces all non-breaking space entities with regular spaces

## Settings

- **Hide &nbsp; in source mode**: Enable or disable the hiding feature

## Why this plugin?

Non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`) are useful for controlling text flow, but can make source editing difficult as they appear as the HTML entity `&nbsp;` which takes up visual space. This plugin makes editing more comfortable by hiding these entities while maintaining their functionality in preview mode.

1. Open Obsidian Settings
